<p style="font-size: 22px; color: yellow; Background-color: Blue;">The Equalizer basketball club is a new basketball club taking part in the Port Moresby National Basketball Association competition. The club was drafted in the competition last year. It was founded by Tiriman Masi a student at Port Moresby National School of Excellence and Agnes Urupua, a second year student at School of Law in the University of Papua New Guinea.</p>

The team was established to keep youths occupied and out of trouble. The Equalizer basketball club is the only club currently in Port Moresby North East. This year the interset has grown and more and more youths are coming to take part in the sport, making basketball a sport that many want to learn.</p>
